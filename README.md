# Awesome Connected and Automated Vehicles <!-- omit in toc -->

My curated list of interesting topics, papers and other resources for connected and autonomous driving vehicles.
This repository is being updated on an ongoing basis as I find/read papers and other resources,
but pull requests are always welcome!

## Datasets

- [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)
  
  KITTI uses the following sensors:
  - 1 Inertial Navigation System (GPS/IMU): OXTS RT 3003
  - 1 Laserscanner: Velodyne HDL-64E
  - 2 Grayscale cameras, 1.4 Megapixels: Point Grey Flea 2 (FL2-14S3M-C)
  - 2 Color cameras, 1.4 Megapixels: Point Grey Flea 2 (FL2-14S3C-C)
  - 4 Varifocal lenses, 4-8 mm: Edmund Optics NT59-917

- [NuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/)
  
  The nuScenes dataset (pronounced /nuːsiːnz/) is a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving provided by nuTonomy-Aptiv. The final dataset will include approximately 1.4M camera images, 400k LIDAR sweeps, 1.3M RADAR sweeps and 1.1M object bounding boxes in 40k keyframes.

- [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets)
  
  Over 10 hours of driving data (LIDAR, camera frames and more)
  
## Courses

- [Udacity: Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)
  
  If your goal is to learn the skills necessary to become a self-driving car engineer, and then secure a rewarding role in the field where you can start applying those skills, this program is the ideal choice. 

## Simulation Tools

- [CARLA](http://carla.org/)

  CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites, environmental conditions, full control of all static and dynamic actors, maps generation and much more.

- [Appolo](http://apollo.auto/)
  
  Apollo is a high performance, flexible architecture which accelerates the development, testing, and deployment of Autonomous Vehicles.
